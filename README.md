# Update

I am not planning to maintain this repository so I am working on a less customizable mod which will hopefully be less daunting for me to update and maintain. Check it out [here](https://github.com/spazzylemons/ProtoPlayerModels).

# Extra Player Models

Adds the ability to create custom player models.

## Installing

This mod requires the [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric-language-kotlin) mod.

## Configuration

The configuration for Extra Player Models can be found under Appearance on the title screen, as a subpage of the vanilla Skin Customization, as well as in [Mod Menu](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modmenu).

## Wiki

Coming soon.
